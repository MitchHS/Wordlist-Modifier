# Generate Me Some Passwords PLS 

This Python script generates a comprehensive list of password variations from an input list of words by applying a series of transformations:

    Capitalization: For each word, it creates three versions: the original, one with the first letter capitalized, and one fully capitalized.

    Letter-to-Number Replacement: It replaces certain letters with numbers in all word versions (e.g., a to 4, e to 3) to mimic common password substitutions.

    Appending Numbers: It appends a sequence of numbers (from 0 to a specified range, defaulting to 9) to each version of the word, both before and after letter-to-number substitutions.

    Appending Special Characters: For each of the above variations, it also creates new versions by appending each special character from a provided list.

The script systematically combines these modifications to produce a vast array of potential passwords based on the original words, including straightforward capitalization and number appending, sophisticated letter-to-number substitutions, and appending special characters, aiming to cover a wide spectrum of common password patterns.
